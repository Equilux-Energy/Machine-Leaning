Welcome to the Machine Learning section of the Peer-to-Peer Energy Trading Project! This repository contains the machine learning components that predict electricity consumption and production for efficient energy trading.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main folders: `Consumption` and `Production`.

### üîã Consumption

The `Consumption` folder contains two models:

1. **Short Term Consumption Model**: Predicts electricity consumption for the next three hours.
2. **Long Term Consumption Model**: Predicts the average daily consumption for a week.

#### Files in `Consumption`:

- `Long Term Consumption Model Pre Processing.ipynb`: üìù Pre-processing notebook for the long-term consumption model.
- `Long Term SGD Regression Model.ipynb`: üß† Python notebook for creating the long-term consumption model.
- `Short Term Consumption Model Pre Processing.ipynb`: üìù Pre-processing notebook for the short-term consumption model.
- `Short Term SGD Regression Model.ipynb`: üß† Python notebook for creating the short-term consumption model.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Production

The `Production` folder contains one model:

1. **Short Term Production Model**: Predicts electricity production for the next three hours.

#### Files in `Production`:

- `Production Model Pre Processing.ipynb`: üìù Pre-processing notebook for the production model.
- `Production SGD Regression Model.ipynb`: üß† Python notebook for creating the production model.
